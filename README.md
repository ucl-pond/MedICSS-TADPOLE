# TADPOLE Challenge: Prediction of Alzheimer's disease evolution using statistical models and machine learning 
## UCL Medical Image Computing Summer School: MedICSS 2020


Project Leads: Leon Aksman and Neil Oxtoby (see also the [2019 version](https://github.com/noxtoby/MedICSS2019-TADPOLE) and [2018 version](https://github.com/mrazvan22/disProgModSummerSchool))

Project description: 

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias affect more than 50 million people worldwide. No current treatments are available that can provaly cure or even slow down AD; all clinical trials have so far failed to prove a disease-modifying effect. One reason why they fail is the difficulty identifying patients at early disease stages, when treatments are most likely to have an effect. The AD Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge has been designed to find the algorithms that can best predict AD evolution and thus help with early identification of at-risk subjects.

This project will be run as a live multi-day competition, where participants will group into teams and create algorithms that will best predict the evolution of real-life participants (anonymous, of course), including probable AD patients, healthy controls, and elderly individuals at risk of AD. We will run a live Kaggle-style leaderboard where participants will make predictions and see their performance results in real time.

## Background

AD, and dementia in general, is a key challenge for 21st century healthcare. The statistics are sobering: 7% of people over 65 and 20% over 80 suffer from dementia of which AD is the most common cause. Dementia has higher health and social care costs than cancer, stroke and chronic heart disease combined. This costs are projected to be $1T in 2018 and $2T in 2030. A treatment slowing progression by 50% would reduce annual care costs by about 10%, i.e. $100B in 2018.

No current treatments provably cure or even slow AD. Of the hundreds of clinical trials into putative treatments (often running to billions of dollars) fewer than 1% have proceeded to the regulatory approval stage and none have managed to prove a disease-modifying effect. One key reason for these failures is difficulty in identifying patients at early stages of the disease where treatments are most likely to be effective.

TADPOLE challenges you to identify what data and algorithms best predict AD progression. This facilitates early identification of patients likely to be receptive to treatment, thus purifying cohorts for clinical trials, highlighting positive treatment effects, and facilitating translation of effective treatments to market.



## TADPOLE

Data science will play a key role in the endeavour to learn more about the causes of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease, currently believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The goal of [The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) Challenge)](https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/) is to identify which people within an age group at risk of AD (Alzheimer's Disease) will start to show symptoms in the short to medium term (1-5 years). It focuses on "rollover individuals" (patients coming from a previous phase) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The challenge is to use historical measurements from these individuals to forecast future measurements. The following scientific questions motivate the challenge:

- How predictable is progression to AD in at-risk individuals?
- Which data, processing pipelines, and predictive models best predict future AD progression?
- Can we use such methods to improve cohort selection for clinical trials?

The TADPOLE datasets contain a list of individuals at an age that puts them at risk of AD, with associated measurements to inform forecasts (from imaging, psychology, demographics, genetics, etc.). Each individual has agreed to a follow-on assessment.

Your challenge is to predict future measurements from these individuals and submit your predictions for evaluation. The original challenge used future measurements for evaluating these forecasts (the data was not available until long after the original challenge submission deadline in Nov 2017), but this deadline has since passed and we will perform the actual evaluation during this summer school project.

## Outcome Variables

The essence of TADPOLE is very simple. We provide a list of individuals previously recruited to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). These individuals have all provided data within earlier ADNI studies and have agreed to provide follow-up data in [ADNI 3](http://adni3.org/), which is just starting. ADNI refers to these individuals as "rollovers"; we will use the same term here. You are asked to forecast three features of each rollover individual at the time of their future data provision. Each feature is a common or likely outcome measure for clinical trials:

#### 1. Clinical status

- `CN` - Cognitively normal;
- `MCI` - mild cognitive impairment; or
- `AD` - probable Alzheimer's Disease
- At any point in time, this is one of CN (cognitively normal), MCI (mild cognitive impairment) or AD (probable Alzheimer's Disease).
- Provide relative likelihood of each option for each individual. Methods/algorithms that don't produce probabilistic estimates can still participate by setting binary probabilites (zero or one). N.B. relative likelihoods != probabilities.
- _Example: relative likelihoods of 1, 2, and 3 for a particular individual in a particular future month mean the participant believes the probabilities pCN, pMCI, and pAD are 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2 for CN, MCI, and AD, respectively, at that future time point. Negative likelihoods will be set to zero._

#### 2. ADAS-Cog13 score

- The ADAS-Cog is frequently used as a primary outcome measure in clinical trials, e.g. [Doody et al., NEJM 2014](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1312889); [Salloway et al., NEJM 2014](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1304839).
- Continuous variable; provide a best-guess value as well as a 50% confidence interval for each individual.
- The intervals indicate the participant's confidence in the prediction. Participants should choose the intervals aiming for a coverage probability of 0.5, i.e. 50% of the best guesses should lie within the corresponding confidence interval.
- _Example: ADAS13 forecast for individual A is 25 with 50% CI of [21, 26]; ADAS13 forecast for individual B is 40 with 50% CI of [25, 50]. There is thus more confidence in the forecast for individual A (CI size 5) than for individual B (CI size 25)._

#### 3. Ventricles volume, divided by intracranial volume

- As estimated via the [standard ADNI image processing pipeline](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/mri-analysis/mri-pre-processing/), which uses the [FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) software.
- Same as ADAS13 (continuous variable, provide best-guess prediction plus 50% CI).

Since we do not know the exact time of future data acquisitions for any individual, **participants must make month-by-month forecasts** for each feature of each individual. Evaluation will use forecasts at the months that correspond to data acquisition.

The table below summarises the format of the forecasts using the above examples:

## Data Sets

The ADNI study has [three phases](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/study-design/): ADNI1, ADNI GO and ADNI2. New participants were recruited across North America during each phase of the study and agreed to complete a variety of imaging and clinical assessments. Participants are followed and reassessed over time to track the pathology of the disease as it progresses. [ADNI3 launched in September 2016](https://fnih.org/what-we-do/current-research-programs/adni3) and will run until 2022, aiming to recruit 1,200 volunteers as well as re-evaluate 800 previous ADNI participants in this time.

There are three "standard" data sets that have been compiled from raw ADNI data for TADPOLE. From these three ADNI datasets (see the [ADNI website for more information on the standard D1, D2, D3 ADNI datasets](https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/data/)), the following two datasets have been compiled for the PyCon UK 2017 Alzheimer's Hackathon:

**LB1_LB2: Longitudinal training set**
Longitudinal measurements (i.e. over multiple visits) with associated outcomes (i.e. labelled training set) compiled from the entire ADNI history. Contains all individuals that have provided data in at least two visits (different dates) across ADNI1, ADNI GO and ADNI2 **up until May 2010**. Data from sources such as MR & PET imaging, cognitive tests, CSF biomarkers and clinical assessment have been processed using standard ADNI data pipelines.

Individuals flagged under the `LB2` column are rollover individuals who will be participating in ADNI3. This is the population for whom TADPOLE predictions should be made. For the PyCon UK hackathon, predicted outcomes will be evaluated against a held-out test set (i.e. recent visits from LB2 rollover patients). For the wider TADPOLE Challenge, predicted outcomes will be evaluated against ADNI3 rollovers once this data is collected in 2018.

**LB4: Longitudinal held-out test set**
Longitudinal measurements for visits for LB2 patients **from May 2010 onwards**.

**Other data sets**
Many other open data sets are available that might serve as useful additional training data should participants wish to look at it. For example:

- [The Global Alzheimerâ€™s Association Interactive Network (GAAIN)](http://www.gaain.org/)
- [Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) Flagship Study of Ageing](https://aibl.csiro.au/)
- [The collection of data sets in the neuGRID for you project](https://neugrid4you.eu/datasets)
- [Longitudinal data in the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) data set](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/drc/research/methods/miriad-scan-database)
